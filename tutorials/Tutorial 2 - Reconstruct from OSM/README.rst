Tutorial 2: Reconstruction from OSM
-----------------------------------

In this tutorial we will reconstruct a _Bacillus subtilis_ ME-model from the OSM. This is useful once you have already run ``builder.generate_files()`` which performs the *Synchronize* and *Complement* steps.

This way is quicker but make sure not to overwrite your OSM re-running the reconstruction in Tutorial 1.
